CS50 Final Project

This is something that works and should be done for real at some point.

Testing readme edit in atom.

Anton edited this readme in Sublime. And note that Sublime > Atom.

Nick edited this line in atom and is noting, officially, that Atom is sick af and Anton should watch his fucking mouth

Cynthia edited this line and hopes it works!!! (for the sake of Nick's bp. Although she can administer nitro if it's an emergency :) )

Cynthia is trying again :3

# new section

This is a new section of the README, which helps organize it when used as a design doc.
