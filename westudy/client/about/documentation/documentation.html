        Documentation: A User Manual
    </h2>

        <!-- Documentation for your project in the form of a file called documentation.html,
        documentation.pdf, documentation.php, or documentation.txt. This documentation
        is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project. Though the structure of your documentation
        is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where,
        if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation
        should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us
        to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission.
        Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation
        any questions that you think we might have while testing your work. -->
