        Design: A Look Under the Hood
    </h2>

        <!-- A "design document" for your project in the form of a file called design.html,
        design.pdf, design.php, or design.txt that discusses, technically,
        how you implemented your project and why you made the design decisions you did.
        Your design document should be at least several paragraphs in length.
        Whereas your documentation is meant to be a userâ€™s manual, consider your design
        document your opportunity to give the staff a technical tour of your project underneath its hood.-->

    <p class="description">
        This will be a technical discussion of the project implementation and our design decisions :)
