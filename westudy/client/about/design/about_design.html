        Design: Technical Details
    </h2>

    <div class="description">
        <p>
            We developed WeStudy using Meteor, a JavaScript app platform written using node.js
            that integrates with MongoDB and features real-time updating to changes in code,
            client-side rendering of data, and ability to write both client and server
            sides of the code in one language: JavaScript. We also used Git to collaborate between programmers.
        </p>
        <p>
            To implement each viewable web page, in .html files we created templates, snippets of HTML that
            include dynamic data and can be called in code by their template name so that
            programmers don't need to write the same HTML code multiple times by hand. A specific example
            of this is seen in the westudy.html file, where we called the template sidebar using syntax which is part of a
            language called Spacebars that Meteor uses to add functionality to HTML.  The folders and files are organized in the project by
            path.  That is, files that load when you visit /accounts are in the client/accounts folder and
            files that load when you visit /forums/view/[post_id] are located in the client/forums/view.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our JavaScript code, we used the syntax Template.TemplateName.events to specify event handlers
            for particular templates. For example, in login.js we first defined an event handler
            to detect the login form submission event. Then, we wrote a function inside the event handler
            using jQuery to get data from the login form (in this case, user email and password), check the email's
            validity, and then log the user in if all went well, otherwise displaying an error message.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also in the JS code for each template, there are onCreated() (or created) and/or onRendered() (or rendered)
            to help handle how the template is loaded.  The created handler will run when the template is created and runs
            only once. The rendered handler will run when the template is rendered in the DOM, and runs when data passed to the DOM changes.
            Also, there is a handler called helpers() which is where a series of helper functions or variables are defined.  These
            variables are what is available to the DOM in each JS file's coresponding HTML file using {{variable}} selectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            For router configuration, we first defined a default layout template that applies to all templates.
            We then used the Router.route syntax to define each route specified by the template's name and then map
            the particular route to a function that routes the user to the specific web page. To ensure that some pages
            would only be viewable to logged-in users, we included a security check which secures certain pages (such as
            Groups and Forums) against unauthorized access. We also made sure to render a Page Not Found for routes that
            do not exist.
        </p>
        <p>
            To store data obtained from the Groups form and Posts form, we defined collections,
            databases in Meteor that integrate with MongoDB. We chose to use MongoDB--and Meteor--in a large part because of
            MongoDB's advantage over table-based relational databasees like MySQL in its structure that favors JSON-like documents,
            which makes for faster integration of data.
        </p>
