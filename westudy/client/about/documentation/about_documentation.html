            To join an existing study group or create a new study group,
            first click on the Groups tab in the sidebar. Then, to join an existing study group,
            scroll down the Groups page to browse through all the currently active study groups, taking note
            of the name of the course, number of members, and the time when the group began studying.
            Once you've found a group matching your needs, click on the list item, and you will be directed to a
            page where you can join the group. To create a new study group,
            click the "+" icon, and you will be directed to a form where you can enter a name
            for your study group, the name of the course you plan on studying, and the study group location.
            To manage the study groups that you've personally created, click on a list item in the Groups page,
            and you will be directed to a page where you can either edit the group's information (such as group
            location if changed) or delete the group once the studying is finished. Deleting the study group
            is as important as creating it, as it will allow other students to only view currrently active
            study groups and minimize confusion!

            option of entering a reply. To create a new discussion in Forums where you can get specific questions
            about your course answered, click the large "+" button at the top of the Forums page and you will
            be directed to a form where you can give your discussion a title, enter content (such as your question),

            discussion forum post you've made, in Home page, click on a list item under "Your Posts" to view your
            discussion and delete it using the "Delete post" button at the botton of the page. You can also
            delete a discussion post by directly clicking on a discussion you've made in the Forums page to view
            and delete the post.
