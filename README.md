# CS50 Final Project

WeStudy is a web app that connects students who want to study together.

Documentation and design docs can be found in the following folders:

Docs: ./westudy/client/about/documentation/documentation.html
Design: ./westudy/client/about/design/design.html

These files can also be viewed from the url paths /about/documentation and /about/design.

The demo vide can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq0t732COzQ or on the /about page

The site is viewable and usable on both PC and mobile browsers.



#How to view site

There are 2 ways you  can view the site.  One is a local copy and one is a copy hosted on the web.

##Viewing a Local Copy

To view a local copy, you need to go to meteor.com and install meteor.  Then, from the
command line, navigate to the westudy folder and run the command 'meteor'.  One the
app builds, it should be accessible at http://localhost:3000

##Viewing Online

We have deployed the most recent version of this app to the following address:
http://westudy.meteor.com . Using this site, you can see updates happening in the
client in real time as people change things in the database.  However, because of
free hosting, it is possible that it is slow / unavailable.
